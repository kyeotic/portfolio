			I have been doing software development professionally since 2010, and web development since 2011. I work primarily in C# and Javascript, and love both of them. I've worked with a of different technologies, and I spent a fair amount of free time tinkering with new frameworks at home.

		<p>
			I have a strong preference for Service Oriented Front End Architecture (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.smart-soft.com/downloads/articles/sofea.html">SOFEA</a>). Lately that has meant a Durandal or Angular client talking to a server running either ServiceStack (Windows) or NodeJS (Linux).
