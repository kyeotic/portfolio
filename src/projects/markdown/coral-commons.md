# Coral Commons

I live in a condo project with a very proactive and positive community, so when I learned they were keeping contact and other information in spreadsheets, I offered to help them out. It was also a good opportunity to play with [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux), [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), and the [blaze compiler](https://github.com/firebase/blaze_compiler).

The app has display and entry screens for Residents and Houses, and mapping between the two. "Verified" accounts can read any data, and write to Residents or Houses that they have been linked to. The HOA board members have write access to everything.

There is also a bulletin board that anyone can post to, which supports Markdown ([CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) flavored). The site was designed with Bootsrap so that it can be easily used on phones, which is how I expect the majority of the community the use the site.
