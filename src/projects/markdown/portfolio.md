# Portfolio

This portfolio, now in its third version, has always been used as a demo ground for my favorite web stack. Originally it was a [Durandal](http://durandaljs.com/) application built with Grunt and ssh deployed to a self-managed [Webfaction](https://www.webfaction.com/) box with Git. While I loved Durandal, (and Knockout, which it was built on), it didn't fare too well with the public and has now been abandonded. The previous version of this portfolio was re-built from scratch with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) using [jspm](http://jspm.io/) and was deployed onto Digital Ocean (I've written a lot about hosting and developing on [Digitial Ocean](https://blog.tyrsius.com/digital-ocean-for-beginners/)). Since I spend most of my time in AWS these days I've started moving my personal work there as well. The conversion was an opportunity to once again align with the community by moving away from jspm to webpack, along with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as a base. This site now serves as a static site out of AWS S3 and is deployed with [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
