		<h2>JS Test Lite</h2>

		<p>
			<a href="http://tyrsius.github.io/jsTestLite/">JSTestLite</a> is  a little tool I made after a frustrating day spent trying to work out some complex logic on a new project. Sometimes you just need to write some quick tests, without the grunt work of setting up your whole project.

			</p>
		<p> 
			JsTestLite is basically <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/" target="_blank">jsFiddle</a> for <a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/" target="_blank">Jasmine</a> unit tests. Write some code, write some tests, check the results. The tests are re-run on keyup in either field (with a debounce of 500ms for performance), and hosted inside of a freshly created iframe to ensure each environment is fresh and unpolluted by previous runs. The input fields use Ace Editor, and a few buttons let you easily resize everything. If you are using a supporting browser, your code is automatically kept in localStorage for you.

			It's a small tool, but it was fun to make. Sometimes the smallest tools are the most useful.
