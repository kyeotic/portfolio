		<h2>Chaos Crusade</h2>
		<p>
			Like a lot of my personal projects Chaos Crusade is unfinished and on indefinite hold. I started it when my friends and I were playing a pen and paper game, while fighting a Google Spreadsheet for character progression tracking. Google Docs offered multi-user real-time updates, which was nice, but a spreadsheet just didn't offer enough guidance for what we were doing. Chaos Crusade was my answer to these problems, but I stopped working on it when we stopped playing the game.

			The reason I am inlcuding this unfinished work here is that I am particularly proud of the central data-sync mechanism that I built for it. It was initially inspired by Meteor, which offers a very similiar system, but was built to integrate with Knockout's data-binding. I don't really like the Backbone-style template system Meteor uses, but I love Knockout. The data-sync ensures that any changes made to a local client are sent to the server, and then to every other active client via Socket.IO. This creates real-time data synchronization between clients. The whole thing is neatly abstracted so that the code using the socket-backed Knockout Objects and Array's can't tell the difference after constructing them. They data-bind and update the same API that you would use for a standard Knockout observable or observableArray. It easily supports any data structure, and adding new "collections" is just a couple lines of code on the server.
