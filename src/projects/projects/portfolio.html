		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
		<p>
			This portfolio represents my ideal tinkering stack. The application itself is built with <a href="http://durandaljs.com/">Durandal</a>, a fairly new MV* Javascript framework that builds on top of Knockout, RequireJS, and jQuery. Having originally come from WPF on the desktop, I am very comfortable thinking about applications in Knockout's MVVM pattern; and Durandal was developed by the same man who created <a href="https://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/">Caliburn.Micro</a>, so it fits in very well.
		</p>

		<p>
			The server is a very basic NodeJS/Express server. It's only responsibility is to serve the <code>index.html</code> that Durandal run's inside of, but do so for every route so that push-state is supported. The server is running on a self-managed <a href="https://www.webfaction.com/">Webfaction</a> box. Deployments are handled by pushing over SSH to a Git server running on the same box, where a post-receive hook unpacks the repository, run's Grunt to run tests and build the app, and restart <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/forever">Forever</a>. A cron-job checks every 15 minutes to ensure it's still up.

			Javascript client, stateless server, deploy with Git, built with Grunt. I love it. If you want to check out the source it's on <a href="https://github.com/tyrsius/portfolio">Github</a>.
