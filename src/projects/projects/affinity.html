		<h2>Affinity</h2>

		<p>Affinity was my first professional solo application. It was a ground-up re-write of a aging Windows Forms application in WPF. I was very lucky with this project, as I was able to develop it under ideal conditions. Redoing an existing application means knowing most of the business problems you are trying to solve, while also having a wealth of existing feedback, both positive and negative, for the existing solutions. I had spent a year using the existing application, and another year developing on it. The application was a help desk ticketing system and parts ordering &amp; inventory managment tool for internal employees, so I had direct access to its users. Feedback on new interfaces and bugs was immediate. My users were technical, which is helpful in many ways.</p>

		<p>The development process taught me a lot about WPF, but more importantly it taught me about the process of developing new software. I learned how to manage feature priority between users and management, to coordinate releases with both a beta team and the call center as a whole, and to set the expectations for both. Once a week I would meet with my direct supervisor (who was not a programmer) and the call center manager to discuss the progress of current work.  We did not have an industry standard development process, since nobody there was familiar with one. Sometimes the requests from management were for solutions with no concern about implementation, and sometimes they were specific about as many details as possible. I started without a release schedule, but after a few months I had settled to releasing every wednesday. I met with the beta team before every release to talk about what was changing. Bugs were reported to me directly as they were discovered, and hotfixes generally went out within 24 hours.

	<p>Everyone was very happy with the product. Ticket load time in the old application had grown to 2-4 seconds, since it loaded everything up-front. I cut the load time to nearly instantaneous by loading as many things as possible asynchronously. The primary ticket interface was re-organized to improve the flow of data entry, as well as move from a Multiple Document Interface to a Tabbed Document Interface. The parts ordering interface was completely overhauled to improve searching and in-line images to help identify many of the generically named parts. I also added a very resilent crash recovery that saved the entire state of all open tickets (including unfinshed parts orders) whenever the application closed improperly.</p>
