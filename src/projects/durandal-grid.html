      <h2>Durandal Grid</h2>
      <p>
        Ko-Grid is the de facto plugin for Knockout if you want to create a databound table, but like SlickGrid it forces you to write HTML-in-string inside your Javascript if you want to customize your rows. Durandal has a much cleaner native way to do such customization via it's data-part overrides in Widgets, which is what I used to create Durandal Grid. It supports asc/desc sorting on properties using the standard <code>sort()</code>, or you can specify your own sort method for each column. It has a standard paging button footer, as well as page size buttons. Finally, it provides easy-to-change row templates so that you can add functionality, or use custom contents.
