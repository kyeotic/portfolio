  * Added `iframe` to whitelist of HTML block tags (as per spec).
  * Removed `pre` from rule 6 of html blocks (see jgm/CommonMark#355).
  * Fixed logic error in calculation of offset.  Here's a test case this
    fixes:
    ```
    % echo -en "1. \t\tthere" | bin/commonmark
    <ol>
    <li>
    <pre><code>ere
    </code></pre>
    </li>
    </ol>
    ```
  * Disallow list item starting with multiple blank lines
    (jgm/CommonMark#332).
  * Fixed bug in list-start parser (#60).
  * Changed smart quote algorithm to agree with cmark (#61).  The change only
    involves double quotes, which now need to be both left flanking and
    not right flanking to count as "can open."
  * Fix replacement of multiple apostrophes in the same paragraph with
    `--smart` (Brandon Frohs).
  * `make bench`: renice to -10 rather than 99.
