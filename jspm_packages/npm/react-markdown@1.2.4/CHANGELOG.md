# Change Log

All notable changes will be documented in this file.


## [1.2.4] - 2016-01-28

### Changed

- Rolled back dependencies because of breaking changes

## [1.2.3] - 2016-01-24

### Changed

- Updated dependencies for both `commonmark` and `commonmark-react-parser` to work around an embarrasing oversight on my part.

## [1.2.2] - 2016-01-08

### Changed

### Fixed

- Use pre-built (dist version) of commonmark renderer in order to work around JSON-loader dependency.

### Added
